#Lab5_FunctionsInC

## Purpose
Write software in C that involves functions, parameters, and if-then conditionals. <br/> 
Write a function that calculates the area of a rectangular room.  <br/>

## What It Does
Take input from the keyboard using scanf and performs output to the display using printf.<br/>
Write a function that accepts two input parameters (length and width) and calculates the area <br/>
of rectangular room with this length and width. The length and width are in meters and the returned<br/> 
area should be in square meters. Calculate the area only if both the length and width are between 3 and 20<br/> 
inclusively. Return a result of zero if the length is less than 3, the width is less than 3, the length <br/>
is greater than 20 or the width is greater than 20. Write the function Calc_Area.<br/>
